### Example: maximum concurrency of 1

Suppose that you have 3 application processes, and each process's maximum concurrency is 1. When the application is idle, none of the processes are handling any requests:

    Process A [ ]
    Process B [ ]
    Process C [ ]

When a new request comes in, Passenger may decide to route the request to process A. Now A has reached its maximum concurrency:

    Process A [*]
    Process B [ ]
    Process C [ ]

Suppose that, while that request is still in progress, two new requests come in. Because A has reached its maximum concurrency, Passenger routes these two new requests to B and C. Now all requests have reached their maximum concurrency:

    Process A [*]
    Process B [*]
    Process C [*]

If a new request comes in while all previous 3 requests are still in progress, then Passenger will decide to spawn a new process. This new incoming request is put in a queue:

    Request queue [*       ]

    Process A [*]
    Process B [*]
    Process C [*]
    Process D (spawning...)

When process D is done spawning, or when one of the existing processes is done with their request (and are no longer at their maximum concurrency), then Passenger will route the queued request to either of those processes.

Suppose D finishes spawning immediately after, then the situation looks like this:

    Request queue [        ]
                    |
    Process A [*]   |
    Process B [*]   |  queued request
    Process C [*]   |  is routed to D
    Process D [*] <-+
