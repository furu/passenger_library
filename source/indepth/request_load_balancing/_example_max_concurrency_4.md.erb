### Example with maximum concurrency 4

Suppose that you have 2 application processes,
<% if language_concurrency_model == :thread -%>
  and you configured the number of threads to 4, causing each process's maximum concurrency to be 4.
<% else -%>
  and the processes' maximum concurrency is configured to 4.
<% end -%>
When the application is idle, none of the processes are handling any requests:

    Process A [    ]
    Process B [    ]

When a new request comes in (which we call α, Passenger will decide to route the request to process A.

    Process A [α   ]
    Process B [    ]

Suppose that, while α is still in progress, 1 more request comes in (which we call β). That request will be load balanced to process B because it is the least busy one:

    Process A [α   ]
    Process B [β   ]

Suppose that another request comes in (which we call ɣ). That will be load balanced to process A again, not to B:

    Process A [αɣ  ]
    Process B [β   ]
