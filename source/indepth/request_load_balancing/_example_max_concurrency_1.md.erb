### Example with maximum concurrency 1

Suppose that you have 3 application processes, and each process's maximum concurrency is 1. When the application is idle, none of the processes are handling any requests:

    Process A [ ]
    Process B [ ]
    Process C [ ]

When a new request comes in (let's call this α), Passenger will decide to route the request to process A. A will then reach its maximum concurrency:

    Process A [α]
    Process B [ ]
    Process C [ ]

Suppose that, while α is still in progress, a new requests comes in (which we call β). That request will be load balanced to process B because it is the least busy one:

    Process A [α]
    Process B [β]
    Process C [ ]

Suppose α finishes. The situation will look like this:

    Process A [ ]
    Process B [β]
    Process C [ ]

If another request comes in (which we call ɣ), that request will be routed to A, not C:

    Process A [ɣ]
    Process B [β]
    Process C [ ]
