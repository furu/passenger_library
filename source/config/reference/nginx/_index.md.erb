## Essentials

### passenger_root

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_root <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>

Refers to the location to the Passenger root directory, or to a location configuration file. This configuration option is essential to Passenger, and allows Passenger to locate its own data files.

You normally do not need to set this configuration option. If you used our [Debian](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/apt_repo/index.html" %>) or [RPM](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/yum_repo/index.html" %>) packages to [install Passenger](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/install/index.html" %>), then they automatically configure `passenger_root` for you with the right value. If you installed Passenger from Homebrew, tarball or RubyGems, then at some point during the installation process you are told what the correct value should be, and instructed to insert it into your Nginx configuration file.

#### What happens if this option is not set, or set wrongly

If you do not set `passenger_root`, Passenger will disable itself, and Nginx will behave as if Passenger was never installed.

If you set `passenger_root` to the wrong value, then Passenger will attempt to locate some of its own files, fail to do so, then complain with an error message and abort Nginx.

#### How to fix passenger_root

If you lost the `passenger_root` configuration value (e.g. because you accidentally removed the Nginx configuration file, and you are trying to reconstruct it), if you didn't follow the installation instructions correctly, or if you [moved Passenger to a different directory](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/moving.html" %>), then you can fix `passenger_root` as follows:

 * If you installed Passenger through source tarball or by cloning it from the Passenger Github repository, then the value should be the path to the Passenger directory.
 * In all other cases, obtain the correct value by running the following command:

       passenger-config --root

Once you have obtained the value, open your Nginx configuration file and insert a `passenger_root` option somewhere with that value.


## Deployment options

### passenger_enabled

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_enabled <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_enabled off;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>2.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option enables or disables Passenger for that particular context. Passenger is disabled by default, so you must explicitly enable it for contexts where you want Passenger to serve your application. Please see [the deployment guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/index.html" %>) for full examples.

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    root /webapps/example/public;

    # You must explicitly set 'passenger_enabled on', otherwise
    # Passenger won't serve this app.
    passenger_enabled on;
}
~~~

Note that since version 5.0.0, `passenger_enabled` is inherited into subcontexts. This was not the case in previous versions.


### passenger_base_uri

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_base_uri <em>uri</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>2.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!-- TODO: fix link -->
Used to specify that the given URI is an distinct application that should be served by Passenger. Please see [the deployment guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/index.html" %>) for more information.

It is allowed to specify this option multiple times. Do this to deploy multiple applications in different sub-URIs under the same virtual host.


### passenger_document_root

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_document_root <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!-- TODO: fix link -->
Used in sub-URI deployment scenarios to tell Passenger where it should look for static files. Please see [the deployment guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/index.html" %>) for more information.


## Application loading options

### passenger_ruby

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_ruby <em>path-to-ruby-interpreter</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_ruby ruby;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The `passenger_ruby` option specifies the Ruby interpreter to use for serving Ruby web applications.

In addition, the `passenger_ruby` option in the `http` context also specifies which Ruby interpreter to use for Passenger's internal Ruby helper tools, e.g. the one used by [passenger_pre_start](#passenger_pre_start). See [Lightweight Ruby dependency](<%= url_for "/indepth/lightweight_ruby_dependency.html" %>) for more information about the internal Ruby helper tools.

If `passenger_ruby` is not specified, then it defaults to `ruby`, which means that the first `ruby` command found in [PATH](<%= url_for "/indepth/environment_variables.html" %>#the-path-environment-variable) will be used.

Closely related to `passenger_ruby` is [passenger_python](#passenger_python), [passenger_nodejs](#passenger_nodejs), etc. The following example illustrates how it works and how you can use these options to specify different interpreters for different web apps.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/nginx/passenger_ruby_example.md", locals: locals) %>

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/passenger_ruby_extra_info.md", locals: locals) %>


### passenger_python

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_python <em>path-to-python-interpreter</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_python python;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option specifies the Python interpreter to use for serving Python web applications. If it is not specified, then it uses the first `python` command found in [PATH](<%= url_for "/indepth/environment_variables.html" %>#the-path-environment-variable).

Closely related to this option is [passenger_ruby](#passenger_ruby), [passenger_nodejs](#passenger_nodejs), etc. The following example illustrates how it works and how you can use these options to specify different interpreters for different web apps.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/nginx/passenger_ruby_example.md", locals: locals) %>


### passenger_nodejs

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_nodejs <em>path-to-node-js</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_nodejs node;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option specifies the Node.js/io.js command to use for serving Node.js/io.js web applications. If it is not specified, then it uses the first `node` command found in [PATH](<%= url_for "/indepth/environment_variables.html" %>#the-path-environment-variable).

Passenger's support for Node.js and io.js are the same. If you want to use io.js instead of Node.js, simply set this option to your iojs binary.

Closely related to this option is [passenger_ruby](#passenger_ruby), [passenger_python](#passenger_python), etc. The following example illustrates how it works and how you can use these options to specify different interpreters for different web apps.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/nginx/passenger_ruby_example.md", locals: locals) %>


### passenger_meteor_app_settings <filename>

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_nodejs <em>path-to-node-js</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_nodejs node;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>5.0.7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When using a Meteor application in non-bundled mode, use this option to specify a JSON file with settings for the application. The `meteor run` command will be run with the `--settings` parameter set to this option.

Note that this option is not intended to be used for bundled/packaged Meteor applications. When running bundled/packaged Meteor applications on Passenger, you should set the `METEOR_SETTINGS` environment variable using [passenger_env_var](#passenger_env_var).


### passenger_app_env

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_app_env <em>name</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Aliases</th>
    <td>
      rails_env <em>name</em>;<br>
      rack_env <em>name</em>;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_app_env production;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option sets, for the current application, the value of the following environment variables:

 * `RAILS_ENV`
 * `RACK_ENV`
 * `WSGI_ENV`
 * `NODE_ENV`
 * `PASSENGER_APP_ENV`

Some web frameworks, for example Rails and Connect.js, adjust their behavior according to the value in one of these environment variables.

Passenger sets the default value to **production**. If you're developing the application (instead of running it in production), then you should set this to `development`.

If you want to set other environment variables, please use [passenger_env_var](#passenger_env_var).

Setting this option also adds the application environment name to the default [application group name](#passenger_app_group_name), so that you can run multiple versions of your application with different application environment names.


### rails_env, rack_env

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>
      rails_env <em>name</em>;<br>
      rack_env <em>name</em>;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>
      rails_env production;<br>
      rails_env production;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>2.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are aliases for [passenger_app_env](#passenger_app_env).


### passenger_app_root

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_app_root <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_app_root <em>parent-directory-of-virtual-host-root</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

By default, Passenger assumes that the application's root directory is the parent directory of the virtual host's (`server` block's) root directory. This option allows one to the application's root independently from the virtual host root, which is useful if your application does not follow the conventions that Passenger assumes.

See also [How Passenger + Nginx autodetects applications](<%= url_for "/indepth/app_autodetection/index.html" %>).

#### Example

~~~nginx
server {
    server_name test.host;
    root /var/rails/zena/sites/example.com/public;
    # normally Passenger would
    # have assumed that the application
    # root is "/var/rails/zena/sites/example.com"
    passenger_app_root /var/rails/zena;
}
~~~


### passenger_app_group_name

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_app_group_name <em>name</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>See description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Sets the name of the application group that the current application should belong to. Its default value is the [application root](#passenger_app_root), plus (if it is explicitly set), the [application environment name](#passenger_app_env).

Passenger stores and caches most application spawning settings -- such as environment variables, process limits, etc -- on a per-app-group-name basis. This means that if you want to start two versions of your application, with each version having different environment variables, then you must assign them under different application group names.

The [request queue](<%= url_for "/indepth/request_queueing.html" %>) is also per-application group, so creating multiple application groups allow you to separate requests into different queues.

#### Example

Consider a situation in which you are running multiple versions of the same app, with each version intended for a different customer. You use the `CUSTOMER_NAME` environment variable to tell the app which customer that version should serve.

~~~nginx
# WRONG example! Doesn't work!

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name customer1.foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_env_var CUSTOMER_NAME customer1;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name customer2.foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_env_var CUSTOMER_NAME customer2;
}
~~~

This example doesn't work, because Passenger thinks that they are the same application. When a user visits customer1.foo.com, Passenger will start a process with `CUSTOMER_NAME=customer1`. When another user visits customer2.foo.com, Passenger will route the request to the application process that was started earlier. Because environment variables are only set during application process startup, the second user will be served the website for customer 1.

To make this work, assign unique application group names:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name customer1.foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_env_var CUSTOMER_NAME customer1;
    passenger_app_group_name foo_customer1;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name customer2.foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_env_var CUSTOMER_NAME customer2;
    passenger_app_group_name foo_customer2;
}
~~~

Note that it is not necessary to set `passenger_app_group_name` if you want to run two versions of your application under different [application environment names](#passenger_app_env), because the application environment name is included in the default application group name. For example, consider a situation in which you want to run a production and a staging version of your application. The following configuration will work fine:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name bar.com;
    root /webapps/bar/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    # Passenger implicitly sets:
    # passenger_app_group_name /webapps/bar/public;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name staging.com;
    root /webapps/bar/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_app_env staging;
    # Passenger implicitly sets:
    # passenger_app_group_name '/webapps/bar/public (staging)';
}
~~~


### passenger_app_type

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_app_type <em>name</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td><a href="<%= url_for "/indepth/app_autodetection/index.html" %>">Autodetected</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

By default, Passenger [autodetects](<%= url_for "/indepth/app_autodetection/index.html" %>) the type of the application, e.g. whether it's a Ruby, Python, Node.js or Meteor app. If it's unable to autodetect the type of the application (e.g. because you've specified a custom [passenger_startup_file](#passenger_startup_file)) then you can use this option to force Passenger to recognize the application as a specific type.

Allowed values are:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Application type</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <% SUPPORTED_APP_TYPES.each do |spec| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= spec[:type] %></td>
        <td><%= spec[:name] %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Example

~~~nginx
server {
    server_name example.com;
    root /webapps/example.com/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    # Use server.js as the startup file (entry point file) for
    # your Node.js application, instead of the default app.js
    passenger_startup_file server.js;
    passenger_app_type node;
}
~~~


### passenger_startup_file

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_startup_file <em>relative-path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td><a href="<%= url_for "/indepth/app_autodetection/index.html" %>">Autodetected</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option specifies the startup file that Passenger should use when loading the application. This path is relative to the [application root](#passenger_app_root).

Every application has a *startup file* or *entry point file*: a file where the application begins execution. Some languages have widely accepted conventions about how such a file should be called (e.g. Ruby, with its `config.ru`). Other languages have somewhat-accepted conventions (e.g. Node.js, with its `app.js`). In these cases, Passenger folows these conventions, and executes applications through those files.

Other languages have no conventions at all, and so Passenger invents one (e.g. Python WSGI with `passenger_wsgi.py`).

Passenger tries to autodetect according to the following language-specific conventions:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Language</th>
      <th>Passenger convention</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <% SUPPORTED_APP_TYPE_CONVENTIONS.each do |spec| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= spec[:name] %></td>
        <td><%= spec[:startup_file] %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end -%>
  </tbody>
</table>

For other cases you will need to specify the `startup-file` manually. For example, on Node.js, you might need to use `bin/www` as the startup file instead if you are using the Express app generator.

#### Notes

 * Customizing the startup file affects [user account sandboxing](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/user_sandboxing.html" %>). After all, if user account sandboxing is enabled, the application is executed as the user that owns the startup file.
 * If you set this option, you **must** also set [passenger_app_type](#passenger_app_type), otherwise Passenger doesn't know what kind of application it is.

#### Example

~~~nginx
server {
    server_name example.com;
    root /webapps/example.com/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    # Use server.js as the startup file (entry point file) for
    # your Node.js application, instead of the default app.js
    passenger_startup_file server.js;
    passenger_app_type node;
}
~~~


### passenger_restart_dir

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_restart_dir <em>relative-path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_restart_dir tmp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

As described in [Restarting applications](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/restart_app.html" %>), Passenger checks the file `tmp/restart.txt` in the [application root directory](#passenger_app_root) to determine whether it should restart the application. Sometimes it may be desirable for Passenger to look in a different directory instead, for example for security reasons (see below). This option allows you to customize the directory in which `restart.txt` is searched for.

You can either set it to an absolute directory, or to a directory relative to the application root.

#### Examples

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.foo.com;
    # Passenger will check for /apps/foo/public/tmp/restart.txt
    root /apps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.bar.com;
    root /apps/bar/public;
    # An absolute filename is given; Passenger will
    # check for /restart_files/bar/restart.txt
    passenger_restart_dir /restart_files/bar;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.baz.com;
    root /apps/baz/public;
    # A relative filename is given; Passenger will
    # check for /apps/baz/restart_files/restart.txt
    #
    # Note that this directory is relative to the APPLICATION ROOT, *not*
    # the value of DocumentRoot!
    passenger_restart_dir restart_files;
}
~~~

#### Security reasons for wanting to customize PassengerRestartDir

Touching restart.txt will [cause Passenger to restart the application](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/restart_app.html" %>). So anybody who can touch restart.txt can effectively cause a Denial-of-Service attack by touching restart.txt over and over. If your web server or one of your web applications has the permission to touch restart.txt, and one of them has a security flaw which allows an attacker to touch restart.txt, then that will allow the attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service.

You can prevent this from happening by pointing `passenger_restart_dir` to a directory that's readable by Nginx, but only writable by administrators.


### passenger_spawn_method

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_spawn_method <em>smart|direct</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>
      For Ruby apps: passenger_spawn_method smart;<br>
      For other apps: passenger_spawn_method direct;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>2.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option controls whether Passenger spawns applications directly, or using a prefork copy-on-write mechanism. The [spawn methods guide](<%= url_for "/indepth/spawn_methods/index.html" %>) explains this in detail.


### passenger_env_var

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_env_var <em>name</em> <em>value</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>5.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Sets environment variables to pass to the application. Environment variables are only set during application loading.

#### Example

~~~nginx
server {
    server_name www.foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;

    passenger_env_var DATABASE_USERNAME foo_db;
    passenger_env_var DATABASE_PASSWORD secret;
}
~~~


### passenger_load_shell_envvars

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_load_shell_envvars <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_load_shell_envvars on;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Enables or disables the loading of shell environment variables before spawning the application.

If this option is turned on, and the user's shell is `bash`, then applications are loaded by running them with `bash -l -c`. The benefit of this is that you can specify environment variables in .bashrc, and they will appear in the application as one would expect.

If this option is turned off, applications are loaded by running them directly from the `Passenger core` process.


### passenger_rolling_restarts

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_rolling_restarts <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_rolling_restarts off;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
  <%= render_partial("/config/reference/enterprise_only.html") %>
</table>

Enables or disables support for [zero-downtime application restarts](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/zero_downtime_redeployments/index.html" %>) through `restart.txt`.

Please note that `passenger_rolling_restarts` is completely unrelated to the `passenger-config restart-app` command. That command always initiates a blocking restart, unless `--rolling-restart` is given.

NOTE: Are you looking to prevent applications from being restarted when you restart Nginx? That is handled by the [Flying Passenger mode](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/flying_passenger.html" %>), not by the rolling restarts feature.

Enables or disables [resistance against deployment errors](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/deployment_error_resistance.html" %>).

Suppose that you have upgraded your application and you have issued a command to restart it, but the application update contains an error (e.g. a syntax error or a database configuration error) that prevents Passenger from successfully spawning a process. Passenger would normally display an error message to the visitor in response to this.

By enabling deployment error resistance, Passenger Enterprise would "freeze" the application's process list. Existing application processes (belonging to the previous version) will be kept around to serve requests. The error is [logged](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/log_file/log_file.html" %>), but visitors do not see any error messages. Passenger keeps the old processes around until an administrator has taken action. This way, visitors will suffer minimally from deployment errors.

[Learn more about this feature in Deployment Error Resistance guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/deployment_error_resistance.html" %>).

Note that enabling deployment error resistance only works if you perform a [rolling restart instead of a blocking restart](<%= url_for "/admin/nginx/restart_app.html" %>#blocking-restart-vs-zero-down-time-restart-(rolling-restart)).

Passenger can display friendly error pages whenever an application fails to start. This friendly error page presents the startup error message, some suggestions for solving the problem, a backtrace and a dump of the environment variables.

This feature is very useful during application development and useful for less experienced system administrators, but the page might reveal potentially sensitive information, depending on the application. For this reason, friendly error pages are disabled by default when [passenger_app_env](#passenger_app_env) (or its aliases such as `rails_env` and `rack_env`) is set to `staging` or `production`, but enabled by default otherwise. You can use this option to explicitly enable or disable this feature.


## Resource control and optimization options

### passenger_max_pool_size

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">

</table>

The maximum number of application processes that may simultaneously exist. A larger number results in higher memory usage,
but improves the ability to handle concurrent HTTP requests.

The optimal value depends on your system's hardware and your workload. Please read the [optimization guide](<%= url_for "/config/#{integration_mode_type}/optimization/index.html" %>) to learn how to find out the optimal value.

If you find that your server is running out of memory then you should lower this value. In order to prevent your server from crashing due to out-of-memory conditions, the default value is relatively low (6).

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/alternative_for_flying_passenger.md", locals: locals.merge(option: "--max-pool-size")) %>


### passenger_min_instances

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_min_instances <em>integer</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This specifies the minimum number of application processes that should exist for a given application. You should set this option to a non-zero value if you want to avoid potentially long startup times after a website has been [idle](#passenger_pool_idle_time) for an extended period of time.

Please note that this option does *not* pre-start application processes during Nginx startup. It just makes sure that when the application is first accessed:

 1. at least the given number of processes will be spawned.
 2. the given number of processes will be kept around even when processes are being [idle cleaned](#passenger_pool_idle_time).

If you want to pre-start application processes during Nginx startup, then you should use the [passenger_pre_start](#passenger_pre_start) option, possibly in combination with `passenger_min_instances`. This behavior might seem counter-intuitive at first sight, but `passenger_pre_start` explains the rationale behind it.

#### Example

Suppose that you have the following configuration:

~~~nginx
http {
    ...
    passenger_max_pool_size 15;
    passenger_pool_idle_time 10;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name foobar.com;
        root /webapps/foobar/public;
        passenger_min_instances 3;
    }
}
~~~

When you start Nginx, there are 0 application processes for 'foobar.com'. Things will stay that way until someone visits 'foobar.com'. Suppose that there is only one visitor. One application process will be started immediately to serve the visitor, while two will be spawned in the background. After 10 seconds, when the idle timeout has been reached, these 3 application processes will not be cleaned up.

Now suppose that there's a sudden spike of traffic, and 100 users visit 'foobar.com' simultaneously. Passenger will start 12 more application processes (`15 - 3 = 12`). After the idle timeout of 10 seconds has passed, Passenger will clean up 12 application processes, keeping 3 processes around.


### passenger_max_instances

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_max_instances <em>integer</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_max_instances 0;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
  <%= render_partial("/config/reference/enterprise_only.html") %>
</table>

The maximum number of application processes that may simultaneously exist for an application. This helps to make sure that a single application will not occupy all available slots in the application pool.

This value must be less than [passenger_max_pool_size](#passenger_max_pool_size). A value of 0 means that there is no limit placed on the number of processes a single application may spawn, i.e. only the global limit of `passenger_max_pool_size` will be enforced.

#### Example

Suppose that you're hosting two web applications on your server, a personal blog and an e-commerce website. You've set [passenger_max_pool_size](#passenger_max_pool_size) to 10. The e-commerce website is more important to you. You can then set `passenger_max_instances` to 3 for your blog, so that it will never spawn more than 3 processes, even if it suddenly gets a lot of traffic. Your e-commerce website on the other hand will be free to spawn up to 10 processes if it gets a lot of traffic.


### passenger_max_instances_per_app

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_max_instances_per_app <em>integer</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_max_instances_per_app 0;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The maximum number of application processes that may simultaneously exist for a single application. This helps to make sure that a single application will not occupy all available slots in the application pool.

This value must be less than [passenger_max_pool_size](#passenger_max_pool_size). A value of 0 means that there is no limit placed on the number of processes a single application may use, i.e. only the global limit of `passenger_max_pool_size` will be enforced.

#### Example

Suppose that you're hosting two blogs (blog A and B) on your server, and that you've set [passenger_max_pool_size](#passenger_max_pool_size) to 10. Under normal circumstances, if blog A suddenly gets a lot of traffic, then A will use all 10 pool slots. If blog B suddenly gets some traffic, then it will only be able to use 1 pool slot (forcefully releasing 1 slot from A) until A's traffic has settled down and it has released more pool slots.

If you consider both blogs equally important, then you can set `passenger_max_instances_per_app` to 5. This way, both blogs will never use more than 5 pool slots.

#### Relation to passenger_max_instances

Unlike [passenger_max_instances](#passenger_max_instances), this configuration option is global (only usable in the `http` context) and applies to all applications. `passenger_max_instances` on the other hand is per-virtual host.

Suppose that you're hosting two web applications on your server, a personal blog and an e-commerce website. You've set [passenger_max_pool_size](#passenger_max_pool_size) to 10. The e-commerce website is more important to you. You can then set `passenger_max_instances` to 3 for your blog, so that it will never use more than 3 pool slots, even if it suddenly gets a lot of traffic. Your e-commerce website on the other hand will be free to use up all 10 slots if it gets a lot of traffic.

In summary, `passenger_max_instances_per_app` divides the pool equally among the different web applications, while 'passenger_max_instances' allows one to divide the pool unequally, according to each web application's relative importance.


### passenger_pool_idle_time

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_pool_idle_time <em>seconds</em>;</td>

    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The maximum number of seconds that an application process may be idle. That is, if an application process hasn't received any traffic after the given number of seconds, then it will be shutdown in order to conserve memory.

Decreasing this value means that applications will have to be spawned more often. Since spawning is a relatively slow operation, some visitors may notice a small delay when they visit your web app. However, it will also free up resources used by applications more quickly.

The optimal value depends on the average time that a visitor spends on a single dynamic page. We recommend a value of `2 * x`, where `x` is the average number of seconds that a visitor spends on a single dynamic page. But your mileage may vary.

When this value is set to `0`, application processes will not be shutdown unless it's really necessary. Here is a situation where Passenger seems necessary to shutdown an application process. Suppose that you have two apps on your server, foo and bar. If a user visits foo, but there are no processes for foo, and at the same time there are lots of application processes for bar (as many as the [pool limit](#passenger_max_pool_size)), then Passenger will wait until one of those bar processes is no longer handling a request. At time time, that process will be shutdown so that Passenger can spawn a foo process.

Setting the value to 0 is recommended if you're on a non-shared host that's only running a few applications, each which must be available at all times.

The preloader process (explained in [Spawn methods](<%= url_for "/indepth/spawn_methods/index.html" %>)) has an idle timeout, [just like the application processes spawned by Passenger do](#passenger_pool_idle_time). That is, it will automatically shutdown a preloader process if it hasn't done anything for a given period.

This option allows you to set the preloader's idle timeout, in seconds. A value of `0` means that it should never idle timeout.

Setting a higher value will mean that the preloader is kept around longer, which may slightly increase memory usage. But as long as the preloader server is running, the time to spawn a Ruby application process only takes about 10% of the time that is normally needed, assuming that you're using the `smart` [spawn method](#passenger_spawn_method). So if your system has enough memory, then is it recommended that you set this option to a high value or to `0`.

</table>

Specifies the I/O concurrency model that should be used for Ruby application processes. Passenger supports two concurrency models:

 * `process` -- single-threaded, multi-processed I/O concurrency. Each application process only has a single thread and can only handle 1 request at a time. This is the concurrency model that Ruby applications traditionally used. It has excellent compatiblity (can work with applications that are not designed to be thread-safe) but is unsuitable for workloads in which the application has to wait for a lot of external I/O (e.g. HTTP API calls), and uses more memory because each process has a large memory overhead.
 * `thread` -- multi-threaded, multi-processed I/O concurrency. Each application process has multiple threads (customizable via [passenger_thread_count](#passenger_thread_count). This model provides much better I/O concurrency and uses less memory because threads share memory with each other within the same process. However, using this model may cause compatibility problems if the application is not designed to be thread-safe.

The maximum number of requests an application process will process. After serving that many requests, the application process will be shut down and Passenger will restart it. A value of 0 means that there is no maximum: an application process will thus be shut down when its [idle timeout](#passenger_pool_idle_time) has been reached.

This option is useful if your application is leaking memory. By shutting it down after a certain number of requests, all of its memory is guaranteed to be freed by the operating system. An alternative (and better) mechanism for dealing with memory leaks is [passenger_memory_limit](#passenger_memory_limit).

<div class="note">
  This option should be considered as a workaround for misbehaving applications. It is advised that you fix the problem in your application rather than relying on this option as a measure to avoid memory leaks.

</table>

The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an application process may take to process a request. If the request takes longer than this amount of time, then the application process will be forcefully shut down, and possibly restarted upon the next request. A value of 0 means that there is no time limit.

This option is useful for preventing your application from getting stuck for an indefinite period of time.

<div class="note">
  This option should be considered as a workaround for misbehaving applications. It is advised that you fix the problem in your application rather than relying on this option as a measure to avoid stuck applications.
</div>

#### Example

Suppose that most of your requests are known to finish within 2 seconds. However, there is one URI, `/expensive_computation`, which is known to take up to 10 seconds. You can then configure Passenger as follows:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    root /webapps/my_app/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_max_request_time 2;
    location /expensive_compuation {
        passenger_enabled on;
        passenger_max_request_time 10;
    }
}
~~~

If a request to '/expensive_computation' takes more than 10 seconds, or if a request to any other URI takes more than 2 seconds, then the corresponding application process will be forced to shutdown.

The maximum amount of memory that an application process may use, in megabytes. Once an application process has surpassed its memory limit, Passenger will let finish processing all its current requests, then shut the process down. A value of 0 means that there is no maximum: the application's memory usage will not be checked.

This option is useful if your application is leaking memory. By shutting it down, all of its memory is guaranteed to be freed by the operating system.

<div class="info">
  <h3 class="notoc">A word about permissions</h3>

    This option uses the <code>ps</code> command to query memory usage information. On Linux, it further queries <code>/proc</code> to obtain additional memory usage information that's not obtainable through <code>ps</code>. You should ensure that the <code>ps</code> works correctly and that the <code>/proc</code> filesystem is accessible by the <code>Passenger core</code> process.

### passenger_stat_throttle_rate

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_stat_throttle_rate <em>seconds</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default (as of 5.0.0)</th>

By default, Passenger performs several filesystem checks (or, in programmers jargon, "`stat()` calls") each time a request is processed:

 * It checks which the application [startup files](<%= url_for "/indepth/app_autodetection/index.html" %>) are present, in order to autodetect the application type.
 * It checks whether [restart.txt](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/restart_app.html" %>) has changed or whether `always_restart.txt` exists, in order to determine whether the application should be restarted.

On some systems where disk I/O is expensive, e.g. systems where the harddisk is already being heavily loaded, or systems where applications are stored on NFS shares, these filesystem checks can incur a lot of overhead.

You can decrease or almost entirely eliminate this overhead by setting `passenger_stat_throttle_rate`. Setting this option to a value of `x` means that the above list of filesystem checks will be performed at most once every `x` seconds. Setting it to a value of '0' means that no throttling will take place, or in other words, that the above list of filesystem checks will be performed on every request.


### passenger_pre_start

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_pre_start <em>url</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

By default, Passenger does not start any application processes until said web application is first accessed. The result is that the first visitor of said web application might experience a small delay as Passenger is starting the web application on demand. If that is undesirable, then this option can be used to pre-started application processes during Nginx startup.

A few things to be careful of:

 * This option accepts the *URL* of the web application you want to pre-start, not a on/off value! This might seem a bit weird, but read on for rationale. As for the specifics of the URL:
   - The domain part of the URL must be equal to the value of the `server_name` option of the `server` block that defines the web application.
   - Unless the web application is deployed on port 80, the URL should contain the web application's port number too.
   - The path part of the URL must point to some URI that the web application handles.
 * You will probably want to combine this option with [passenger_min_instances](#passenger_min_instances) because application processes started with `passenger_pre_start` are subject to the usual idle timeout rules. See the example below for an explanation.

<div class="note">
  This option is currently not available when using <a href="<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/flying_passenger.html" %>">Flying Passenger</a>.
</div>

#### Example 1: basic usage

Suppose that you have the following web applications.

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
}

server {
    listen 3500;
    server_name bar.com;
    root /webapps/bar/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
}
~~~

You want both of them to be pre-started during Nginx startup. The URL for foo.com is `http://foo.com/` (or, equivalently, `http://foo.com:80/`) and the URL for bar.com is `http://bar.com:3500/`. So we add two `passenger_pre_start` options, like this:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
}

server {
    listen 3500;
    server_name bar.com;
    root /webapps/bar/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
}

passenger_pre_start http://foo.com/;           # <--- added
passenger_pre_start http://bar.com:3500/;      # <--- added
~~~

#### Example 2: pre-starting apps that are deployed in sub-URIs

Suppose that you have a web application deployed in a sub-URI `/store`, like this:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myblog.com;
    root /webapps/wordpress;
    passenger_base_uri /store;
}
~~~

Then specify the `server_name` value followed by the sub-URI, like this:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myblog.com;
    root /webapps/wordpress;
    passenger_base_uri /store;
}

passenger_pre_start http://myblog.com/store;    # <----- added
~~~

The sub-URI *must* be included; if you don't then the option will have no effect. The following example is wrong and won't pre-start the store web application:

~~~nginx
passenger_pre_start http://myblog.com/;    # <----- WRONG! Missing "/store" part.
~~~

#### Example 3: combining with passenger_min_instances

Application processes started with `passenger_pre_start` are also subject to the idle timeout rules as specified by [passenger_pool_idle_time](#passenger_pool_idle_time)! That means that by default, the pre-started application processes for foo.com and bar.com are shut down after a few minutes of inactivity. If you don't want that to happen, then you should combine `passenger_pre_start` with [passenger_min_instances](#passenger_min_instances), like this:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_min_instances 1;      # <--- added
}

server {
    listen 3500;
    server_name bar.com;
    root /webapps/bar/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    passenger_min_instances 1;      # <--- added
}

passenger_pre_start http://foo.com/;
passenger_pre_start http://bar.com:3500/;
~~~

#### So why a URL? Why not just an on/off flag?

An option that accepts a simple on/off flag is definitely more intuitive, but due technical difficulties w.r.t. the way Nginx works, it's very hard to implement it like that:

It is very hard to obtain a full list of web applications defined in the Nginx configuration file(s). In other words, it's hard for Passenger to know which web applications are deployed on Nginx until a web application is first accessed, and without such a list Passenger wouldn't know which web applications to pre-start. So as a compromise, we made it accept a URL.

#### What does Passenger do with the URL?

During Nginx startup, Passenger will send a dummy HEAD request to the given URL and discard the result. In other words, Passenger simulates a web access at the given URL. However this simulated request is always sent to localhost, *not* to the IP that the domain resolves to. Suppose that bar.com in example 1 resolves to 209.85.227.99; Passenger will send the following HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 port 3500 (and not to 209.85.227.99 port 3500):

~~~
HEAD / HTTP/1.1
Host: bar.com
Connection: close
~~~

Similarly, for example 2, Passenger will send the following HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 port 80:

~~~
HEAD /store HTTP/1.1
Host: myblog.com
Connection: close
~~~

#### Do I need to edit /etc/hosts and point the domain in the URL to 127.0.0.1?

No. See previous subsection.

#### My web application consists of multiple web servers. What URL do I need to specify, and in which web server's Nginx config file?

Put the web application's `server_name` value and the server block's port in the URL, and put `passenger_pre_start` on all machines that you want to pre-start the web application on. The simulated web request is always sent to 127.0.0.1, with the domain name in the URL as value for the 'Host' HTTP header, so you don't need to worry about the request ending up at a different web server in the cluster.

#### Does passenger_pre_start support https:// URLs?

Yes. And it does not perform any certificate validation.


## Connection handling options

### passenger_set_header

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_set_header <em>HTTP-header-name</em> <em>value</em>;</td>

  </tr>
</table>

Sets additional HTTP headers to pass to the web application. This is comparable to `ngx_http_proxy_module`'s `proxy_set_header` option. Nginx variables in the value are interpolated.

Example:

~~~nginx
server {
    server_name www.foo.com;
    root /webapps/foo/public;
    passenger_enabled on;

    passenger_set_header X-Power-Level 9000;
    passenger_set_header X-Forwarded-For internal-router.foo.com;
}
~~~

<div class="warning">
  <h3 class="notoc">This configuration option is NOT inherited across contexts</h3>
  <p>
    In each new context (e.g. in each new <code>location</code> block), you must re-specify <code>passenger_set_header</code>. Values set in parent contexts have no effect on subcontexts. For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">server {
    ...
    passenger_set_header X-Foo foo;

    location /users {
        passenger_enabled on;
        <span class="c"># !!!THIS IS WRONG!!! The 'X-Foo' header will not
        # be passed URLs beginning with /users because we didn't
        # re-specify passenger_set_header.</span>
    }

    location /apps {
        passenger_enabled on;
        <span class="c"># This is correct. Here we re-specify passenger_set_header,
        # so the 'X-Foo' header will be correctly passed to URLs
        # starting with /apps.</span>
        passenger_set_header X-Foo foo;
    }
}</pre>
</div>


### passenger_max_request_queue_size

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_max_request_queue_size <em>integer</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_max_request_queue_size 100;</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When all application processes are already handling their maximum number of concurrent requests, Passenger will queue all incoming requests. This option specifies the maximum size for that queue. If the queue is already at this specified limit, then Passenger will immediately send a "503 Service Unavailable" error to any incoming requests. You may use [passenger_request_queue_overflow_status_code](#passenger_request_queue_overflow_status_code) to customize the response status.

A value of 0 means that the queue is unbounded.

[This article on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20402801/what-is-optimal-value-for-phusion-passenger-passengermaxrequestqueuesize) explains how the request queue works, what it means for the queue to grow or become full, why that is bad, and what you can do about it.

You may combine this option with [passenger_intercept_errors](#passenger_intercept_errors) and [error_page](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page) to set a custom error page whenever the queue is full. In the following example, Nginx will serve /error503.html whenever the queue is full:

~~~nginx
passenger_intercept_errors on;
error_page 503 /error503.html;
~~~


### passenger_request_queue_overflow_status_code

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_request_queue_overflow_status_code <em>code</em>;</td>

    <td>passenger_request_queue_overflow_status_code 503;</td>

    <td>4.0.15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option allows you to customize the HTTP status code that is sent back when the request queue is full. See [passenger_max_request_queue_size](#passenger_max_request_queue_size) for more information.


### passenger_sticky_sessions

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_sticky_sessions <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_sticky_sessions off;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>

When sticky sessions are enabled, all requests that a client sends will be routed to the same originating application process, whenever possible. When sticky sessions are disabled, requests may be distributed over multiple processes, and may not necessarily be routed to the originating process, in order to balance traffic over multiple CPU cores. Because of this, sticky sessions should only be enabled in specific circumstances.

For applications that store important state inside the process's own memory -- that is, as opposed to storing state in a distributed data store, such as the database or Redis -- sticky sessions *should* be enabled. This is because otherwise, some requests could be routed to a different process, which stores different state data. Because processes don't share memory with each other, there's no way for one process to know about the state in another process, and then things can go wrong.

One prominent example is the popular [SockJS library](http://sockjs.org/), which is capable of emulating WebSockets through long polling. This is implemented through two HTTP endpoints, `/SESSION_ID/xhr_stream` (a long polling end point which sends data from the server to the client), and `/SESSION_ID/xhr_send` (a normal POST endpoint which is used for sending data from the client to the server). SockJS correlates the two requests with each other through a session identifier. At the same time, in its default configuration, it stores all known session identifiers in an in-memory data structure. It is therefore important that a particular `/SESSION_ID/xhr_send` request is sent to the same process where the corresponding `/SESSION_ID/xhr_stream` request originates from; otherwise, SockJS cannot correlate the two requests, and an error occurs.

So prominent examples where sticky sessions should (or even *must*) be enabled, include:

 * Applications that use the SockJS library (unless configured with a distributed data store)
 * Applications that use the Socket.io library (unless configured with a distributed data store)
 * Applications that use the faye-websocket gem (unless configured with a distributed data store)
 * Meteor JS applications (because Meteor uses SockJS)

Sticky sessions work through the use of a special cookie, whose name can be customized with [passenger_sticky_sessions_cookie_name](#passenger_sticky_sessions_cookie_name). Passenger puts an identifier in this cookie, which tells Passenger what the originating process is. Next time the client sends a request, Passenger reads this cookie and uses the value in the cookie to route the request back to the originating process. If the originating process no longer exists (e.g. because it has crashed or restarted) then Passenger will route the request to some other process, and reset the cookie.

If you have a load balancer in front end of Passenger, then you must configure sticky sessions on that load balancer too. Otherwise, the load balancer could route the request to a different server.


### passenger_sticky_sessions_cookie_name

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_sticky_sessions_cookie_name <em>name</em>;</td>

    <td>4.0.45</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Sets the name of the [sticky sessions](#passenger_sticky_sessions) cookie.


### passenger_ignore_client_abort

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_ignore_client_abort <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_ignore_client_abort off;</td>

    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Normally, when the HTTP client aborts the connection (e.g. when the user clicked on "Stop" in the browser), the connection with the application process will be closed too. If the application process continues to send its response, then that will result in EPIPE ("Broken pipe") errors in the application, which will be printed in the error log if the application doesn't handle them gracefully.

If this option is turned on then, upon a client abort, Passenger will continue to read the application process's response while discarding all the read data. This prevents EPIPE errors but it will also mean the application process will be unavailable for new requests until it is done sending its response.


### passenger_intercept_errors

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_intercept_errors <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

Decides if Nginx will intercept responses with HTTP status codes of 400 and higher.

By default, all responses are sent as-is from the application or from the Passenger core. If you turn this option on then Nginx will be able to handle such responses using the Nginx [error_page](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page) option. Responses with status codes that do not match an `error_page` option are sent as-is.


### passenger_pass_header

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_pass_header <em>header-name</em>;</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some headers generated by application processes are not forwarded to the HTTP client. For example, `X-Accel-Redirect` is directly processed by Nginx and then discarded from the final response. This option allows one to force Nginx to pass those headers to the client anyway, similar to how [proxy_pass_header](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass_header) works.

Example:

~~~nginx
location / {
   passenger_pass_header X-Accel-Redirect;
}
~~~


### passenger_ignore_headers

    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Disables processing of certain response header fields from the application, similar to how [proxy_ignore_headers](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ignore_headers) works.


### passenger_headers_hash_bucket_size

    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>

</table>

Sets the bucket size of the hash tables used by the [passenger_set_header](#passenger_set_header) directive. The details of setting up hash tables are can be found in [the Nginx documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/hash.html).


### passenger_headers_hash_max_size

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>

</table>

Sets the maximum size of the hash tables used by the [passenger_set_header](#passenger_set_header) directive. The details of setting up hash tables are can be found in [the Nginx documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/hash.html).


### passenger_buffer_response

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_buffer_response <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When turned on, application-generated responses are buffered by Nginx. Buffering will happen in memory and also on disk if the response is larger than a certain threshold.

Before we proceed with explaining this configuration option, we want to state the following to avoid confusion. If you use Passenger for Nginx, there are in fact two response buffering systems active:

 1. The Nginx response buffering system. `passenger_buffer_response` turns this on or off.
 2. The Passenger response buffering system, a.k.a. "real-time disk-backed response buffering". This buffering system is always on, regardless of the value of `passenger_buffer_response`, but its behavior can be tweaked with [passenger_response_buffer_high_watermark](#passenger_response_buffer_high_watermark).

Response buffering is useful because it protects against [slow HTTP clients](<%= url_for "/indepth/slow_clients.html" %>) that do not read responses immediately or quickly enough. Buffering prevents such slow clients from blocking web applications that have limited concurrency. Because Passenger's response buffering is always turned on, you are always protected. Therefore, `passenger_buffer_response` is off by default, and you never should have to turn it on.

If for whatever reason you want to turn Nginx-level response buffering on, you can do so with this option.

Nginx's response buffering works differently from Passenger's. Nginx's buffering system buffers the entire response before attempting to send it to the client, while Passenger's attempts to send the data to the client immediately. Therefore, if you turn on `passenger_buffer_response`, you may interfere with applications that want to stream responses to the client.

So keep in mind that enabling `passenger_buffering_response` will make streaming responses
impossible. Consider for example this piece of Ruby on Rails code:

~~~ruby
render :text => lambda { |response, output|
  10.times do |i|
    output.write("entry #{i}\n")
    output.flush
    sleep 1
  end
}
~~~

...or this piece of Ruby Rack code:

~~~ruby
class Response
  def each
    10.times do |i|
      yield("entry #{i}\n")
      sleep 1
    end
  end
end

app = lambda do |env|
  [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/plain" }, Response.new]
end
~~~

When `passenger_buffer_response` is turned on, Nginx will wait until the application is done sending the entire response before forwarding it to the client. The client will not receive anything for 10 seconds, after which it receives the entire response at once. When `passenger_buffer_response` is turned off, it works as expected: the client receives an "entry X" message every second for 10 seconds.


### passenger_response_buffer_high_watermark

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_response_buffer_high_watermark <em>bytes</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_response_buffer_high_watermark 134217728; <em>(128 MB)</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>5.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

As explained in [passenger_buffer_response](#passenger_buffer_response), Passenger has two response buffering mechanisms. This option configures the maximum size of the real-time disk-backed response buffering system. If the buffer is full, the application will be blocked until the client has fully read the buffer.

This buffering system has a default size of *128 MB* (134217728 bytes). This default value is large enough to prevent most applications from blocking on slow clients, but small enough to prevent broken applications from filling up the hard disk.

You can't disable real-time disk-backed response buffering, but you can set the buffer size to a small value, which is effectively the same as disabling it.

Most of the time, you won't need to tweak this value. But there is one good use case where you may want set this option to a low value: if you are streaming a large response, but want to detect client disconnections as soon as possible. If the buffer size is larger than your response size, then Passenger will read and buffer the response as fast as it can, offloading the application as soon as it can, thereby preventing the application from detecting client disconnects. But if the buffer size is sufficiently small (say, 64 KB), then your application will effectively output response data at the same speed as the client reads it, allowing you to detect client disconnects almost immediately. This is also a down side, because many slow clients blocking your application can result in a denial of service, so use this option with care.

If your application outputs responses larger than 128 MB and you are not interested in detecting client disconnects as soon as possible, then you should raise this value, or set it to 0.

A value of 0 means that the buffer size is unlimited.

These options have the same effect as [ngx_http_proxy_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html)'s similarly named options. They can be used to modify the maximum allowed HTTP header size. Please refer to:

 * [proxy_buffer_size](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffer_size)
 * [proxy_buffers](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffers)

## Logging and debugging options

### passenger_log_level

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_log_level <em>number</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default (as of 5.0.0)</th>
    <td>passenger_log_level 3;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option allows one to specify how much information Passenger should log to its log file. A higher log level value means that more information will be logged.

Possible values are:

 * `0` (crit): Show only critical errors which would cause Passenger to abort.
 * `1` (error): Also show non-critical errors -- errors that do not cause Passenger to abort.
 * `2` (warn): Also show warnings. These are not errors, and Passenger continues to operate correctly, but they might be an indication that something is wrong with the system.
 * `3` (notice): Also show important informational messages. These give you a high-level overview of what Passenger is doing.
 * `4` (info): Also show less important informational messages. These messages show more details about what Passenger is doing. They're high-level enough to be readable by users.
 * `5` (debug): Also show the most important debugging information. Reading this information requires some system or programming knowledge, but the information shown is typically high-level enough to be understood by experienced system administrators.
 * `6` (debug2): Show more debugging information. This is typically only useful for developers.
 * `7` (debug3): Show even more debugging information.


### passenger_log_file

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_log_file <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_log_file <em>path-to-nginx-global-error-log</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>5.0.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

By default Passenger log messages are written to the Nginx global error log. With this option, you can have those messages logged to a different file instead.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/alternative_for_flying_passenger.md", locals: locals.merge(option: "--log-file")) %>


### passenger_file_descriptor_log_file

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_file_descriptor_log_file <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_file_descriptor_log_file <em>path-to-nginx-global-error-log</em>;</td>
  </tr>

    <td>5.0.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Log file descriptor debug tracing messages to the given file.

Passenger has the ability to log all file descriptors that it opens and closes. These logs are useful to the Passenger developers for the purpose of analyzing file descriptor leaks.

File descriptor activity is logged as follows:

 * If `passenger_file_descriptor_log_file` is not set, then file descriptor activity is logged to the [main log file](#passenger_log_file), but only if the [log level](#passenger_log_level) is 5 (debug) or higher.
 * If `passenger_file_descriptor_log_file` is set, then file descriptor activity is logged to the specified file, regardless of the log level.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/alternative_for_flying_passenger.md", locals: locals.merge(option: "--file-descriptor-log-file")) %>


### passenger_debugger

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_debugger <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_debugger off;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
  <%= render_partial("/config/reference/enterprise_only.html") %>
</table>

<div class="note">
  At this time, this feature is supported for Ruby applications only.

Turns support for Ruby application debugging on or off. Please read the [Ruby debugging console](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/debugging_console/ruby/index.html" %>) guide for more information.


## Advanced options

### passenger_instance_registry_dir

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_instance_registry_dir <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_instance_registry_dir /tmp|/var/run/passenger-instreg;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>5.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Specifies the directory that Passenger should use for registering its current instance.

When Passenger starts up, it creates a temporary directory inside the _instance registry directory_. This temporary directory is called the _instance directory_. It contains all sorts of files that are important to that specific running Passenger instance, such as Unix domain socket files so that all the different Passenger processes can communicate with each other. Command line tools such as `passenger-status` use the files in this directory in order to query Passenger's status.

It is therefore important that, while Passenger is working, the instance directory is never removed or tampered with. However, the default path for the instance registry directory is the system's temporary directory, and some systems may run background jobs that periodically clean this directory. If this happens, and the files inside the instance directory are removed, then it will cause Passenger to malfunction: Passenger won't be able to communicate with its own processes, and you will see all kinds of connection errors in the log files. This malfunction can only be recovered from by restarting Nginx. You can prevent such cleaning background jobs from interfering by setting this option to a different directory.

This option is also useful if the partition that the temporary directory lives on doesn't have enough disk space.

The instance directory is automatically removed when Nginx shuts down.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/alternative_for_flying_passenger.md", locals: locals.merge(option: "--instance-registry-dir")) %>

#### Default value

The default value for this option is as follows:

 * If you are on Red Hat and CentOS, and installed Passenger through [the RPMs provided by Phusion](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/yum_repo/index.html" %>), then the default value is `/var/run/passenger-instreg`.
 * Otherwise, the default value is the value of the `$TMPDIR` environment variable. Or, if `$TMPDIR` is not set, `/tmp`.

#### Note regarding command line tools

Some Passenger command line administration tools, such as `passenger-status`, must know what Passenger's instance registry directory is in order to function properly. You can pass the directory through the `PASSENGER_INSTANCE_REGISTRY_DIR` or the `TMPDIR` environment variable.

For example, if you set 'PassengerInstanceRegistryDir' to '/my_temp_dir', then invoke `passenger-status` after you've set the `PASSENGER_INSTANCE_REGISTRY_DIR`, like this:

~~~bash
export PASSENGER_INSTANCE_REGISTRY_DIR=/my_temp-dir
sudo -E passenger-status
~~~

Notes regarding the above example:

 * The -E option tells 'sudo' to preserve environment variables.
 * If Passenger is installed through an RVM Ruby, then you must use `rvmsudo` instead of `sudo`.


### passenger_data_buffer_dir

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_data_buffer_dir <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>See description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>5.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
</table>

By default, Passenger buffers large web application responses. This prevents [slow HTTP clients](<%= url_for "/indepth/slow_clients.html" %>) from blocking web applications by reading responses very slowly. This feature is also known as "real-time disk-backed response buffering".

By default, such buffers are stored in the directory given by the `$TMPDIR` environment variable, or (if `$TMPDIR` is not set) the `/tmp` directory. This configuration option allows you to specify a different directory.

Changing this option is especially useful if the partition that the default directory lives on doesn't have enough disk space.

If you've specified such a directory (as opposed to using Passenger's default) then you *must* ensure that this directory exists.

<%= render_partial("/config/reference/alternative_for_flying_passenger.md", locals: locals.merge(option: "--data-buffer-dir")) %>


### passenger_fly_with

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_fly_with <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>Flying Passenger mode disabled</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.1.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http</td>
  </tr>
  <%= render_partial("/config/reference/enterprise_only.html") %>
</table>

Enables the [Flying Passenger](<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/flying_passenger.html" %>) mode, and configures Nginx to connect to the Flying Passenger daemon that's listening on the given socket filename.

## Union Station options

### union_station_filter

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>union_station_filter "<em>string</em>";</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>Union Station filter disabled</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>3.0.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In each place, it may be specified multiple times, allowing one to define multiple
filters. All defined filters are combined together with logical AND.

Please note that when specifying a configuration value in the Nginx config file,
if the value contains spaces then it needs to be surrounded by double quote
characters.
Otherwise Nginx will think you're trying to pass multiple values to
a config option that only supports a single value. Because of this,
one must escape any special characters in the filter source.

The filter language is [described here](../../union_station_filter_language.html).

Example:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    root /webapps/example/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    union_station_support on;
    union_station_key ...;

    # The filter must be surrounded by double quote characters,
    # and any double quote characters that appear in the filter
    # source must be escaped.
    union_station_filter "starts_with(uri, \"/users\")";

    # Alternatively you can use the single quote string syntax
    # so you don't have to escape double quote characters in
    # the filter source:
    union_station_filter "starts_with(uri, '/users')";

    # !!!! Don't do this! !!! Nginx will report a syntax error!
    # union_station_filter starts_with(uri, "/users");
}
~~~

Another example:

~~~nginx
server {
    listen *:80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    root /webapps/example/public;
    union_station_support on;
    union_station_key ...;

    union_station_filter "starts_with(uri, '/users')";
    union_station_filter "response_time > 100000";

    # The above two directives together have the same effect
    # as specifying this single directive:
    union_station_filter "starts_with(uri, '/users') && response_time > 100000";
}
~~~
